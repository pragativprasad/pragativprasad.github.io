      <description>A majority of my work so far has been in respitatory viruses and HIV, so developing models for vector-borne viruses is a fun challenge for me. Here, we have my take on a Chikungunya model developed by Yakob &amp;amp; Clements for the 2006 Réunion Island outbreak.
They mention that there are approximately 785,000 inhabitants on Réunion Island so I assume that this is the population size they use.
For the mosquito population: 9 million?</description>
