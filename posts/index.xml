      <description>This is a summary of December 2022 published pandemic modelling literature. There’s a lot of commentary on mathematical models and their pitfalls as it pertains to pandemic science this month.
I searched “pandemic mathematical modelling” on PubMed, filtering between 12/01/2022 and 12/31/2022, on December 24, 2022, which resulted in 47 journal articles. This I reviewed titles and abstracts of each of the 47 articles to only include papers about transmission models.</description>

      <title>How Models Were Used in the COVID-19 Pandemic</title>

      <description>While mathematical models themselves have proved to be interesting to dissect, it&amp;rsquo;s really important to understand the process by which they are used in decision-making. The COVID-19 pandemic has documented this in great detail, and I&amp;rsquo;ll be sharing some peer-reviewed articles that might be particularly useful in understanding how models were used in the pandemic.
In April of 2020, Panovska-Griffiths asks the question &amp;ldquo;Can mathematical modeling solve the current Covid-19 crisis?</description>

      <description>I quit my job this month and am starting my PhD in Epidemiology.
This has been a long time coming My main motivation has always been to work on healthcare/public health problems and using computational techniques to achieve that, but it took me awhile to find the right avenue.
I started off as a computational biologist in 2015. After two years of developing antibody modeling software, I decided to study population-level health and started a masters degree in epidemiology.</description>

      <title>Model 2: A Chikungunya Model</title>

      <description>A majority of my work so far has been in respitatory viruses and HIV, so developing models for vector-borne viruses is a fun challenge for me. Here, we have my take on a Chikungunya (CHIKV) model developed by Yakob &amp;amp; Clements for the 2006 Réunion Island outbreak.
I try a couple of different versions of the model to try to replicate the results here. This post is a short example of the process that goes into model development.</description>

      <description>The following is my rendition of a 2018 Kong et al. model for the 2014 dengue (DENV) outbreak in Guangzhou, China using EpiModel.
I developed the SEIR-SEI model described by Kong et al., where SEIR respresents the human compartments and SEI represents the vector compartments. The total infections for this outbreak depending on transmission heterogeneity (kappa) ranges between 558,000 and 10 million (Table 1). This illustrates the importance of accounting for dispersion (i.</description>
