      <description>I quit my job this month and am starting my PhD in Epidemiology.
This has been a long time coming My main motivation has always been to work on healthcare/public health problems and using computational techniques to achieve that, but it took me awhile to find the right avenue.
I started off as a computational biologist in 2015. After two years of developing antibody modeling software, I decided to study population-level health and started a masters degree in epidemiology.</description>
