      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a year since I started my PhD!!! I&amp;rsquo;m so excited to call myself a 2nd year PhD student soon. Here, I&amp;rsquo;d like to assess what I&amp;rsquo;ve accomplished, how I&amp;rsquo;ve felt about it, and lessons I&amp;rsquo;ve learned.
Revisiting this graphic. The only thing missing here is that there is a line for each requirement and project, overlapping each other, with several Vallies of Despair aligning at the same point in time ðŸ˜… I would like to say that I am firmly in Phase 4 for a number of projects, which is great.</description>

      <description>I quit my job this month and am starting my PhD in Epidemiology.
This has been a long time coming My main motivation has always been to work on healthcare/public health problems and using computational techniques to achieve that, but it took me awhile to find the right avenue.
I started off as a computational biologist in 2015. After two years of developing antibody modeling software, I decided to study population-level health and started a masters degree in epidemiology.</description>
