      <description>This is a summary of December 2022 published pandemic modelling literature. There’s a lot of commentary on mathematical models and their pitfalls as it pertains to pandemic science this month.
I searched “pandemic mathematical modelling” on PubMed, filtering between 12/01/2022 and 12/31/2022, on December 24, 2022, which resulted in 47 journal articles. This I reviewed titles and abstracts of each of the 47 articles to only include papers about transmission models.</description>

      <title>How Models Were Used in the COVID-19 Pandemic</title>

      <description>While mathematical models themselves have proved to be interesting to dissect, it&amp;rsquo;s really important to understand the process by which they are used in decision-making. The COVID-19 pandemic has documented this in great detail, and I&amp;rsquo;ll be sharing some peer-reviewed articles that might be particularly useful in understanding how models were used in the pandemic.
In April of 2020, Panovska-Griffiths asks the question &amp;ldquo;Can mathematical modeling solve the current Covid-19 crisis?</description>
